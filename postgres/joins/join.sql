UNION & UNION ALL are used to merge two differnt queries. 

UNION returns always unique records so any duplicate data while merging these queries will be eliminated.

UNION ALL displays all records including the duplicate records.

When using both UNION, UNION ALL operators, the number of columns and 
their data type must match among the different queries.
